These are a collection of plugins I've made for the Garry's Mod roleplaying framework Helix. They're designed for use with the mode of HL2RP, however /might/ be able to be used with other modes on IX.


If you use any of my plugins, feel free to edit them as you wish, but please don't try and claim these as your own. Thank you :)

 == Description Of Plugins ==
 
 v_animfixes       ; A plugin which just improves compatability with IX by giving models the proper animation class. No more tposing! Included addons are documented in the plugin.
 
 v_doorkick        ; A plugin which lets you kick down a door if you're the right faction, or if you have the right strength. Default factions are MPF, OTA, and Vortigaunts, and the default strength requirement is 30 or higher.
