# == Read Me! ==
These are a collection of plugins I've made for the Garry's Mod roleplaying framework Helix.

If you use any of my plugins, feel free to edit them as you wish, but please don't try and claim these as your own. If you do any edits, let me know! I'd love to know what you do.

Thank you :)

# Made For Servers
These plugins have been made for various servers, and typically will be the most refined products out of this repository.
## [ Archon ]
### [Archon Factions - Chumtoad](https://github.com/xVal429/IX-Plugins/tree/master/%5B%20Archon%20%5D/archon_factions_chumtoad)
REQUIREMENT: [Half-Life Resurgence](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2548809283)

Adds a standalone Chumtoad faction with a custom animation class to actually ensure they function. Uses the Half-Life Resurgence Chumtoad.
- Includes low-light vision for first-person, the first-person effects can be toggled.
- Includes some config things.

## [ Leviathan ]
### [apollo-attributes](https://github.com/xVal429/IX-Plugins/tree/master/%5B%20Leviathan%20%5D/apollo-attributes)
An unfinished yet functional rolling system which works similar to D&D. 
- Includes the ability to do multiple dice rolls, crit fails, crit successes, etc. 1d20? Sure. 5d37? Yeah, you can do that.
- Also includes some unused stuff like when an attribute is used, and also contains a used section for aliases, so the player won't have to type in "deception" for instance, they can just type "dec".
- The code would probably make a medieval peasant explode, and it's not the most efficient, but it works.

### v_chatmodifier
A plugin to add a prefix & suffix to a message.
- Made upon request, does not require an item or faction, though can very easily be modified to do so.
- Usage: /chatmodifier "prefix" "suffix".
- Does not persist through restarts.

# [ Deprecated ]
I do not offer support for any of these plugins anymore. They may or may not work, and exist to showcase my older work/so I can look back on it.
#### v_animfixes
> A plugin which just improves compatability with IX by giving models the proper animation class. No more tposing! Included addons are documented in the plugin.

#### v_doorkick
> A plugin which lets you kick down a door if you're the right faction, or if you have the right strength. Default factions are MPF, OTA, and Vortigaunts, and the default strength requirement is 70 or higher & you pass a RNG check with a default 30% chance. MPF and OTA have specific sequences/sounds to them, however please make sure you're using a model with 'metropolice' and 'overwatch' animatons. For Overwatch you might need the Universal Animation Fix, i'm not sure. 

#### ix_stunstick
> Just an improved stunstick SWEP over the original.  Has voltage settings for varying damage. Made for one of my previous servers, not made by me but I was given permission to upload it.

#### v_rollstat
> Stat/attribute based rolling, made upon request, never updated. Report any bugs to me, no guarantees I'll fix them, though.

#### val_drg folder
> Various (one) nextbots made on the DrG nextbot base. Currently contains a Zombine which supports player possession. Nextbot only has melee attacks, will add the bombing later on. DISCLAIMER: The zombine is /awful/ and is only up so I can look back on old code. I do not suggest using it. It is mediocre.
